				<h3> Who We are?<br></h3>
				Foody Couple is an online community dedicated to good food.

				Sukanya Saha. They

				are a real-life couple and they love to eat good food at all.

				take pictures of the food and loves to share them with the

				world. Whereas Titas

				was always been a content creator. Their thoughts were

				merged. Foody Couple was

				born. It was all started in September of 2017. It was

				started as a very small

				food community and it is still kept on growing.<br>
				<h3>How do we operate?<br></h3>
